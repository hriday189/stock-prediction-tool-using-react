# stock-prediction-tool-using-react
I have create a stock prediction app using React. This app will allow users to input a stock symbol and get a simple prediction based on historical data
This stock prediction app includes the following features:

1. A form where users can enter a stock symbol.
2. A simulated function to fetch historical stock data (in a real app, you'd replace this with an actual API call).
3. A simple prediction function that calculates the average of the last known price and the overall average price.
4. A chart displaying the historical stock prices using the shadcn/ui chart components.
5. A display of the predicted next price for the stock.
   Remember that stock predictions are inherently uncertain, and no prediction method is 100% accurate. i will advise users to do their own research and consult with financial professionals before making investment decisions.
